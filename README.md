## Description of Programs

### test.py
Fetches package information from the PyPI JSON API using the requests library.

### linear_algebra.py
Performs matrix multiplication using NumPy. This operation is fundamental in machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and neural networks.

### transpose_demo.py
Computes the transpose of a matrix. Transpose operations are widely used in data preprocessing, covariance computation, and PCA.

### eigen_demo.py
Calculates eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix using NumPy. Eigen decomposition is a key step in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DHINESH0202/github-task-1.git

cd github-task-1

### 2. Install dependencies
pip install numpy
pip install requests

### 3. Run the programs
python test.py
python linear_algebra.py
python transpose_demo.py
python eigen_demo.py

## Data Science Relevance
The implemented NumPy operations form the mathematical foundation for many data science and machine learning techniques:

- Matrix multiplication is used in model training and neural networks  
- Transpose operations are used in covariance and feature transformations  
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in PCA and dimensionality reduction
